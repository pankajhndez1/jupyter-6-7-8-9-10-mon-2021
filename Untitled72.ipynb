    "In most of the object-oriented languages access modifiers are used to limit the access to the variables and functions of a class. Most of the languages use three types of access modifiers, they are - private, public and protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like any other object oriented programming language, access to variables or functions can also be limited in python using the access modifiers. Python makes the use of underscores to specify the access modifier for a specific data member and member function in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access modifiers play an important role to protect the data from unauthorized access as well as protecting it from getting manipulated. When inheritance is implemented there is a huge risk for the data to get destroyed(manipulated) due to transfer of unwanted data from the parent class to the child class. Therefore, it is very important to provide the right access modifiers for different data members and member functions depending upon the requirements."

This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as ((  private variable  )). \n",

Similarly, the sales section handles all the sales-related activities and keeps records of all the sales. Now there may arise a situation when for some reason an official from the finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular month. In this case, he is not allowed to directly access the data of the sales section. He will first have to contact some other officer in the sales section and then request him to give the particular data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of the sales section and the employees that can manipulate them are wrapped under a single name “sales section”. Using encapsulation also hides the data. In this example, the data of the sections like sales, finance, or accounts are hidden from any other section.\n"
